Figure 1:
The `corner` package was used to generate the corner plot with `emcee_sampler_output.p`.
For accurately getting the overall rate, we must account for the fact that the injections sample includes sources \tau > 10 ms, but the rate should not.
The overall computed factor is `rate_correction_factor = 0.8165`, which should multiply the zeroth column of the pickle file. This value is derivable using the injections data release (https://www.canfar.net/citation/landing?doi=22.0005).

Figure 9:
This can be generated using the data in `P_obs(z).dat`.

Figure 10:
This can be generated using the data in `P_obs(z|DM).npz`.
